				<h2>Welcome to tutorial hell!</h2>
				<hr/>
				<p>This site serves as a resource for various things that I know some stuff about and wanted to teach to other people. <i>This includes but is not limited to:</i></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Web development, starting from the very basics</li>
					<li>Some plurality related resources</li>
					<li>Life advice we've picked up and learnt over the years</li>
				</ul>
				<Callout color="warning" title="Disclaimer" details>
					<p>I'm just some guy in my early 20s. I don't claim to have infinite wisdom. These are just things that I found useful and want to share with others, nothing more than that.</p>

					<h2>Who made this site?</h2>
					<p><b>I'm Jake!</b> Also known as PALS. I use "I" and "we" interchangeably (<a href="https://morethanone.info">why?</a>). I like creating things! I want other people to enjoy creating things too. That's why I made this site. Because a lot of my friends struggle with more formal learning resources, just like me.</p>
